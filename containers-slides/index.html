          <h3>Machine-Level Virtualization</h3>

          <p>The mechanism by which one machine (OS/CPU/RAM/etc.) can simulate another.</p>
          <p>Dates to IBM machines of the late-60s. x86 virtualization is barely 20 years old.</p>
          <p>Performance downsides, but guest VMs are fully isolated from each other.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Very briefly, system virtualization is the mechanics of running an operating
            system with no knowledge that is not running directly on hardware.</p>

            <p>Processes are completely isolated from each other. They have no knowledge of the manager (hypervisor).</p>

            <p>Performance downsides since there usually has to be translation and / or a middleware between the actual
            hardware calls.</p>

            <p>Newer techniques have closed the gap, but this is a fundamental characteristic of full virtualization.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>OS-Level Virtualization</h3>

          <p>One kernel running (fully) isolated processes without resorting to hardware virtualization.</p>
          <p>Relatively recent, as in-kernel support for these features have only been added in the last ~15 years.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>A way of isolating applications and resources without resorting to full levels of hardware indirection.</p>

            <p>Resource isolation is barely 15 years old and has exploded in popularity in the passed 10. These are containers.</p>

            <p>Performance and resource allocation have been the primary drivers. Without a hypervisor, processes can get (incredibly close to, if not) full performance and much more efficient resource allocation.</p>

            <p>The almighty google has been using operating system virtualization apparently for around 10 years, most likely for the cost efficiency gains.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>chroot</h3>

          <p>Earliest (~1982) method of resource isolation. Allows a user to completely isolate a directory tree from the rest of the operating system.</p>
          <p>No isolation for processes, network, ACL.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <pre style="margin: 0">
VBoxManage startvm 'container demos' -type headless

sudo chroot --userspec=steve:steve busybox/ ./busybox sh
./busybox ls -la

ssh steve@192.168.33.50
sleep infinity & echo $!; fg

./busybox kill pid
            </pre>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>FreeBSD & Solaris</h3>

          <p>Next iteration of operating system-level virtualization. Building on chroot, provides isolation for processes, networking and users.</p>
          <p>FreeBSD jails were released in 1998 and Solaris containers in 2004.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>http://phk.freebsd.dk/pubs/sane2000-jail.pdf</p>

            <p>Nothing to say really, except maybe they were the first full kernel implementations of containers.</p>

            <p>There are some cool things possible with ZFS snapshotting and containers.</p>

            <p>Linux emulation is possible afaik, but not very mature. Essentially, DTrace + Docker + ZFS might be possible.</p>

            <p>Linux VServer and OpenVZ is about as old as solaris containers, but was not first-class kernel supported. It was released as patches</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Linux Containers</h3>

          <p>A combination of two features: cgroups and namespace isolation. Less than 10 years old.</p>
          <p>cgroups (control groups) provides resource control for groups of processes</p>
          <p>namespace isolation provides the "security" aspect of containers, making sure processes cannot affect one another</p>
          <p>LXC (LinuX Containers) was the first driver for containers on Linux</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>These are the buildings blocks of containers</p>
            <p>LXC brings them together in a usable set of tools</p>
            <p>The popularity of linux relative to freebsd and solaris is the main driver</p>
            <p>Not groundbreaking, but this is the most important part of modern container support, as they are first class kernel features.</p>
          </aside>

        <section>
          <section>
            <h3>Docker</h3>

            <p>The new hotness in containers. Open sourced in 2013 by a PaaS called dotCloud.</p>
            <p>First engine was LXC, but replaced with their own libcontainer driver.</p>
            <p>A "Dockerfile" defines a series of steps towards packaging up a reusable container.</p>
            <p>Write once, run everywhere</p>

            <img style="float:right; width:300px;" src="images/Mugatu-So-Hot-Right-Now.jpg" />

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Combines a client-server model with an API to manage containers.</p>
              <p>Essentially, the next step in packaging binaries for Linux. Completely self-contained runtimes including dependencies.</p>
              <p>It really is the easiest to use solution so far, this explains the popularity.</p>
              <p>Docker is trying to become your one stop PaaS solution.</p>
              <p>In terms of real innovation, it builds on the shoulders of the past 20 years of container development with nice wrapping paper.</p>

          <h3>CoreOS, rkt, systemd-nspawn and appc</h3>

          <p>The "backlash" against Docker's monopolization of the recent container efforts.</p>
          <p>appc (app container specification) is an attempt to standardize on one format for images, discovery and runtimes</p>
          <p>rkt is an alternative runtime for containers without a server model</p>
          <p>systemd-nspawn is another LXC alternative that ships with systemd</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>CoreOS competes with Docker on creating PaaS systems.</p>
            <p>appc is an attempt to bridge the gap, but it really isn't selfless</p>
            <p>CoreOS's rkt is their runtime to run ACI (app container images), but does not use a client-server model. Instead it tries to work with the init system (ostensibly systemd). It can run docker images.</p>
            <p>systemd (the new replacement init system) has their own LXC-type replacement, nspawn, but it's still very new</p>

          <h3>Containers @ Zendesk (a.k.a. Meatballs)</h3>

          <p>We're still very early in the process of "Docker-izing" our infrastructure</p>
          <p>zendesk/docker-images is in the public beta stage and we'd love for everyone to test it out</p>
          <p>"cattle not pets"</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We are all in on docker</p>
            <p>The value it proposes: build once run everywhere is very important to our infrastructure requirements</p>
            <p>The quote "cattle not pets" is floated around. Essentially, application runtimes should be able to be killed and brought up anywhere else</p>
            <p>zdi is a nice wrapper around docker, but play around and get to know it</p>
